# Data Engineering Nanodegree Projects
Projects developed under Udacity's [Data Engineering Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027) program.

## Project 1: [Data Modeling with Postgres](https://github.com/sertozlu/Data-Engineering-Nanodegree-Projects/tree/master/Data-Modeling-with-Postgres)
Apply data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. Define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus to model user activity data for a music streaming app. Write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into tables in Postgres using Python and SQL. 

## Project 2: [Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra](???)
