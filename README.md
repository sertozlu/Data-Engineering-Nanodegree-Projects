# Data Engineering Nanodegree Projects
Projects developed under Udacity's [Data Engineering Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027) program.

## Project 1: [Data Modeling with Postgres](https://github.com/sertozlu/Data-Engineering-Nanodegree-Projects/tree/master/Data-Modeling-with-Postgres)
Apply data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. Define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus to model user activity data for a music streaming app. Write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.

## Project 2: [Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra](https://github.com/sertozlu/Data-Engineering-Nanodegree-Projects/tree/master/Data-Modeling-with-Apache-Cassandra)
Apply data modeling with Apache Cassandra and complete an ETL pipeline using Python. Model data by creating tables in Apache Cassandra to run queries. Part of the ETL pipeline that transfers data from a set of CSV files within a directory to create a streamlined CSV file to model and insert data into Apache Cassandra tables is provided.
